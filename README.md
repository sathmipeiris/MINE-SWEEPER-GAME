# MINE SWEEPER GAME
Mine Sweeper is a console-based game where players identify and flag mine locations in a field. The game offers three field sizes, each with a different number of mines. Players interact with the game by entering commands to place a flag or reveal a location. The game ends when a player reveals a mine or correctly flags all mines.
